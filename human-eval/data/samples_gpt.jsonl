For larger numbers, it checks divisibility by 2 and 3, and then it uses a loop to check divisibility by all integers of the form `6k \u00b1 1` up to the square root of `n`. This is an optimization over checking all numbers up to `n`, as a larger factor of `n` must be paired with a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n\nThe `x_or_y` function then uses the `is_prime` function to determine whether to return `x` or `y`."}
